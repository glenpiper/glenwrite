## Garrett Center Request/Proposal Options (DRAFT)  

**(1) Summary Description **
The Garrett Center has experienced both technical and usability issues with shared mailbox and calendar. These issues have made collaboration more difficult and laborious than need be.  
They have requested assistance in addressing these issues by inquiring about the feasibility of using Google’s G-Suite for Education.  
Below, find two approaches to meeting the needs outlined by the Garrett Center:
- Access shared mailbox on mobile devices
- Access shared files via a common drive/work space
- Shared files need to be simply accessible by both Garrett Center staff and outside consultants  

**(2) Use SHSU Standard Technology Offerings **
Currently, SHSU has standardized on Microsoft’s Office 2016 & Office 365 (O365) suites as the supported methods for email, calendaring, and file sharing.  
IT@Sam proposes the following, in order to meet the requested services while staying within the official University standards:
- Shared Mailbox Mobile Access
	- While the current inability to access shared mailboxes via the Microsoft Outlook mobile app is a known issue, there is a simple/effective alternative — Outlook Web Access (OWA) via mobile web browser
	- OWA is available now, and we could help get this set up & running for Garrett Center staff in short order
- Shared Calendar Access (Mobile & Desktop Clients)
	- This can also be done in fairly short order
- Shared Files — Access & Editing
	- This can be done, although we would have to do some investigation of the exact setup & process, as shared access is not yet a standard offering (it is, however, still possible/available to meet specific needs)
	- Some combination of O365 and/or SharePoint will enable this need to met; we just need to do some work to document the process & develop some training
- Proposal:
	- IT@Sam assists in the configuration & training for using OWA to access shared mailbox
	- IT@Sam determines process for enabling shared calendar access, followed by documentation & training
	- IT@Sam investigates what needs to be done to fully enable full file sharing & editing via O365 and/or SharePoint, after which documentation & training will be delivered to the Garrett Center staff by an agreed upon date

**(3) Request G-Suite for Education **
As stated in the previous section, SHSU has standardized on Microsoft product offerings. Google offerings are neither installed, nor supported.   
That being said, the Garrett Center is certainly able to make a formal request for purchasing access to G-Suite for Education. Such a request would, however, need to go through a more formal project request & evaluation process, as it would necessitate both a departure from/addition to the campus standards, and potentially require changes to back-end IT infrastructure.  
Currently, an unknown variable is whether or not the Garrett Center is required to use G-Suite for Education by grants and/or agencies. If there is a requirement of this type, then that would constitute a re-examination of all factors/assumptions.
