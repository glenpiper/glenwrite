During a recent audit you confirmed your local administrator access on your computer(s). For continued local administrator privileges, you will need to complete both the course titled "Local Administrator Access" and the "Local Admin Request Form" via Talent Management. 
 
We have added you to the Local Admin Users Group. This kicks off a process that does several things:
1. Your supervisor receives and email requesting their approval for you to begin the Local Administrator Access course, which also serves as their authorization of your need to have local admin privileges;
2. You will receive an email notifying you that you have been added to the group and how you can go about accessing the course;
	- Note: There are two prerequisites for this course, "Non-Disclosure Agreement" and "Security Awareness Training." If you've not yet completed the prerequisites or your supervisor has not yet approved the course, then "Launch" will be grayed out;
3. You can access the prerequisites and course via your Talent Management transcript by logging into MySam > Employee Tab > Human Resources Channel > Talent Management, and then once in Talent Management by clicking on Learning > View Your Transcript.

Once the course and form are available, you will need to complete both within the next 30 days to continue to have local administrator access on your computer. If any circumstances prevent you from successfully completing both requirements within the next 30 days, please let us know so we can grant an extension where appropriate. Also, please contact us should you no longer require local admin access.

This audit (approval and certification) process is done when local admin privileges are first requested, and annually thereafter, in order to maintain compliance with security best practices. If you have any questions about this process, please contact the Service Desk Manager, Glen Piper (glen.piper@shsu.edu).
