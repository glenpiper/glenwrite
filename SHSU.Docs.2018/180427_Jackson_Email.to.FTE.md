-->
All:

Just to clarify, as I think there’s been a little bit of confusion/miscommunication, Jackson’s schedule is as follows:
+ M: OFF
+ T: 8am – 2pm @TWC
+ W: 4pm – 6pm @SD
+ R: 8am – 2pm @TWC
+ F: 8am – Noon & 2pm – 5pm @SD
+ NOTES:
	+ He was hired as a TWC Student Tech, which has a different PD/set of job duties & expectations than the main campus/SD student techs, with the main difference being that TWC student techs are not to be on the phones;
		+ *Sub-note 1:* I agreed to give him hours here so that I could get him for the hours/coverage at TWC…;
	+ His W 4-6 shift is at the SD, where he should work at the Front Desk, handling walk-ins & Bomgar sessions (both of which are duties in line with what TWC Student Techs are hired to do) – this allows both SD student techs to be available for the phones and/or 10mp;
	+ For his F shift(s) he is being made available to A/V, in order for them to train him so that he can take that knowledge back to TWC & share it with DJ & Elizabeth;
		+ *Sub-note 2:* It’s also in recognition of his need for more hours, as well as to try to be good teammates and get A/V a little extra help in a plausible fashion  this does not mean that he works for A/V, or that he could work for Tech Shop if A/V doesn’t have anything for him;
		+ *Sub-note 3:* if A/V doesn’t have anything for him, then we’ll pull him back to the SD and have him work at the Front Desk, to lessen our exposure on days like today (4/27) when staffing levels force us to risk leaving the front empty.

If there are any questions about this, please let me know.
