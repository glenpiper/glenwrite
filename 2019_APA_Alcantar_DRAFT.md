*Comments:
Mike's first year in the Tech II role has been one of steady improvement while he worked to become more comfortable with his new responsibilities. He asked good questions, retained the answers, and has been able to pass the information along to coworkers.


**2. ATTITUDE:

*5 - Exceeds - Has a positive and encouraging attitude and makes a positive contribution to morale
*4 - Above - Shows pride in work
*3 - Acceptable - Maintains a good attitude the majority of the time, though improvement could be made
*2 - Below - Lacks a positive attitude towards work environment

*Comments:
Mike is a key contributor and leader in the Service Desk. He is invariably positive in his outlook and team oriented in his focus. He is very good at working with the students, encouraging them even as he holds them accountable & coaches them towards improvement. He shows pride in his work without being overly proud or self-centered.


**3. EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION:

*Consider how employee responds and interacts with employees and others within SHSU or groups outside of SHSU.

*5 - Exceeds - Builds rapport with a variety of people; develops alliances to work together toward common goals
*4 - Above - Effectively handles difficult external relations
*3 - Acceptable - Adapts self to others and to most situations; seeks guidance when needed
*2 - Below - Sometimes rigid and defensive with outside departments

*Weight: 9%

Selected: 3

*Comments:
For the most part, Mike is effective in his communication & interaction with clients and other groups within Client Services. This has carried over from his time as a Tech I, and has improved as he's become more comfortable in his role as a Tech II. His interactions with the other IT departments is more of a work in progress, as Mike is still getting acquainted with some of the players and learning many of the relationships. I fully expect that time will yield a comfort level and mastery of both.


**4. INITIATIVE:

*Consider employee’s ingenuity for completing extra or self-initiated projects or assignments, adaptability to change, and employee’s initiative in completing assignments ahead of schedule.

*5 - Exceeds - Develops new ideas and methods to improve quality of results
*4 - Above - Seeks additional knowledge pertaining to job
*3 - Acceptable - Follows formal instructions as necessary
*2 - Below - Shows little interest in current practices relating to job
*1 - Does Not Meet - Unwilling to demonstrate interest in gaining new knowledge

*Weight: 9%

Selected: 4

*Comments:
Mike is always looking for new things to learn and new, better, ways to approach getting things done. When given specific instructions, Mike can be counted on to not only follow them, but to also offer salient suggestions along with the requested results. He knows the importance of adding value.


**5. INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS:

*Consider whether employee works harmoniously and effectively with fellow employees, management and students.

*2 - Below - Sometimes rigid and defensive; does not foster good working environment

*Weight: 9%

Selected: 4

*Comments:
Mike is a tremendously positive presence at the Service Desk, and a vital element in the positive mix that we currently enjoy. He gets along amazingly well with coworkers and students, and is quickly learning the self-confidence necessary to excel in interactions outside the group, particularly with middle and upper management.


**6. JOB KNOWLEDGE:

*5 - Exceeds - Has completely mastered job; strives to learn more/improve job skills

*1 - Does Not Meet - Unable to complete job duties; poor understanding of job

*Weight: 9%

Selected: 3

*Comments:
Mike's job knowledge of, and familiarity with, the requirements of a Tech II is steadily increasing. Through no fault of his own, owing to a vacancy in the Service Desk for the majority of the past year, Mike wasn't able to truly transition from the operational duties of a Tech I to those of a Tech II until January. This slowed his assimilation of Tech II skills, albeit for the greater good. That said, in the past three months, Mike has made great strides in developing his new skill set and responsibilities.


**7. ORGANIZATION AND USE OF TIME:

*Consider employee’s ability to organize and prioritize their work and how effectively time is used.

*5 - Exceeds - Extremely capable in coordinating tasks in changing situations
*4 - Above - Plans skillfully; handles unusual situations well
*3 - Acceptable - Completes assignments within time expected; meets schedules
*2 - Below - Difficulty in determining priority and schedule of duties
*1 - Does Not Meet - Ineffective in routine tasks; cannot prioritize or schedule

*Weight: 9%

Selected: 4

*Comments:
I can count on Mike. He has stepped up in his new role, such that I can now count on him for more than just handling the phones and working tickets. If an example needs to be set/modeled, Mike gets it done. If info needs to get communicated to the students across the day's shifts, Mike gets it done. If a tricky incident needs to be handled and/or investigated properly, Mike gets it done. He is good and he wants to keep learning and improving.


**8. QUALITY OF WORK:

*5 - Exceeds - Requires minimum supervision; consistently thorough and accurate
*4 - Above - Requires little supervision; is exact and precise most of the time; seldom makes errors
*3 - Acceptable - Usually accurate; makes minimal errors
*2 - Below - Makes above average number of errors; final product often needs revision or correction
*1 - Does Not Meet - Makes frequent and recurrent errors

*Weight: 9%

Selected: 3

*Comments:
Generally speaking, Mike does not need much oversight and produces high quality work. At times, particularly when things get really busy and/or odd/complex, some errors can slip in. This is not a big issue, nor is it a frequent one, but it is one that can be viewed as an area for focus and improvement. Experience and self-confidence will bring the ability to have things slow down just enough to enable the focus and quality to improve.


**9. QUANTITY OF WORK:

*Consider assignments completed, overall productivity, and amount of work done during the workday.

*5 - Exceeds - Produces consistently high volume of work; extremely productive and fast
*4 - Above - Volume of work frequently above that which is expected
*3 - Acceptable - Volume of work is limited to tasks assigned
*2 - Below - Volume of work is generally below what is expected; does just enough to get by
*1 - Does Not Meet - Minimum requirements not met; volume of work generally unsatisfactory

*Weight: 9%

Selected:

*Comments:
Mike produces not only good work, but he produces a good amount of it. The mix of his work product has been changing as he has transitioned more completely into the Tech II role/duties, and I anticipate this to continue in the future. As it does, and as he becomes more comfortable with the new expectations/duties, I also expect the quantity of work to increase.


**10. RESPONSIBILITY AND DEPENDABILITY:

*Consider the employee’s willingness to take on assignments and be held accountable.

*5 - Exceeds - Requires minimum supervision; seeks additional responsibility; is very reliable
*4 - Above - Reliable; requires little supervision; carries through effectively
*3 - Acceptable - Usually takes care of necessary tasks and completes them with reasonable promptness
*2 - Below - Frequently requires prompting; often fails to meet deadlines
*1 - Does Not Meet - Unreliable; requires close supervision; does not accept responsibility

*Weight: 9%

Selected:

*Comments:
While Mike was always willing to take on assignments and accountability, he has really stepped up during the past year. Rarely do I need to seek him out and remind him of tasks and deadlines. On the one occasion that he initially avoided accountability, when I presented him with the facts and reiterated that we operate in a culture of accountability & improvement, not blame & reprisal, Mike quickly responded with improved performance.


**11. USE OF REQUIRED TECHNOLOGY:

*Consider how employee utilizes the resources provided by SHSU Information Technology Services.

*5 - Exceeds - Has mastery level knowledge of required technology and as new ideas or technologies are introduced, is able to learn and use them swiftly and appropriately
*4 - Above - Has substantial knowledge of required technology
*3 - Acceptable - Possesses skills and knowledge to perform their job competently
*2 - Below - Needs to expand knowledge of basic technology
*1 - Does Not Meet - Lacks basic knowledge of technology

*Weight: 9%

Selected:

*Comments:
This is a tricky category for the Service Desk, as the fluid & ever changing nature of the technology we support makes it difficult for anyone to truly "master" everything. That said, Mike makes a really good run at it and is probably at a 4.5/5 & the all-around tech leader at the Service Desk. He pushes himself to learn the base/standard technologies, the changes that new tech cause in/to them, and to quickly get up to speed on the new tech as it hits us. And while he's doing this, he also keeps in mind the necessity of processing it in such a way that it becomes understandable for the SD staff and clients.


**12. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENT:

*Has the employee met the professional development training requirement? (8 hours for staff or 12 hours for managers). A response is required.

*Comments:

Yes, Mike met this requirement.


**13. PERFORMANCE STRENGTHS:

*Please highlight the employee's performance strengths in the section provided. Provide short, bullet-style comments for discussion during the employee conference.

*Comments:

- Dependable & Accountable
- Outstanding Colleague
- Great Attitude - even in times of stress
- Wants to Improve & Learn - both technology and process/operations/strategy
- Coachable


**14. AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:

*Please highlight the employee's areas for improvement in the section provided. Provide short, bullet-style comments for discussion during the employee conference.

*Comments:

- Self-Confidence
- Decision-making
- Expanding & Developing Experience(s) outside of basic call & ticket processing
- Improve Ticket Documentation - as a way of aiding Tier 2/3 support, modeling best practice for peers, and developing a forensic, evidentiary base for research & planning
