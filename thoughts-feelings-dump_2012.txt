1. I am very sensitive to language. While I will try (within reason) to be less so, words do have meaning, and this is a good thing. Especially during this time when I am trying/working to get better, I am even more sensitive than normal to things like words/phraseology/etc. It's how I understand myself, other people, and the world. And it's the only real way in which I can process/know/get how the world will understand me. So, yes, language and its use is important…
2. I'm tired of being treated like I'm **always** super highly volatile
3. And that I'm the **only one** who is volatile in the house
4. I'm tired of feeling under constant scrutiny, under the guise of worries about the volatility issue, no matter what I'm doing and/or when I'm doing it
5. I'm tired of the scrutiny having a value-judgement aspect assigned to it - i.e., I (me personally) am constantly being judged good or bad
6. I'm tired of my actions/decisions/etc always having the specter of personal good/bad hanging over them, rather than just being actions
	* When questions get couched in *"Whatever you want…"* or *"Whatever you like…"* language, that is counterproductive;
	* Rather, *"What do you think…"* or *"Whatever you think…"* are better, b/c they allow for the possibility (indeed, the perceived likelihood) that all factors **other than** base selfish motivations will factor into the process (i.e., the best possible construction will apply…)
7. I'm tired of being treated/held to a higher standard than I'm doing to others
	* I just want to go about my business/daily life, loving/supporting/being with my family, without having to constantly worry about being judged/evaluated at every turn
8. My decisions & choices are not solely, or even primarily, motivated by purely selfish/self-serving motivations (e.g., what I "want", "like", etc…), and I do not ascribe those base motivations to others by default; I would expect & appreciate the same in return.
9. I know I make mistakes -- doesn't mean I like to hear about them repeatedly, or be made to feel like I'm "bad", or to have my own words thrown back at me
10. I love my family unconditionally. 
	* There is nothing any one of them could do to change that
	* Even when I get angry with one, or with something one of them does, that does not mean I think they are "bad"/"evil"/"wrong"
	* Even when correcting is needed, "correcting" ≠ "fixing"/"bending to will"/"character change"
