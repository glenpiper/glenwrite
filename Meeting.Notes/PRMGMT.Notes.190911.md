* FYI - PR 10671 - NOTE - WebDev typically does not put in CR for content changes. WebDev does put in CR for code changes. In this case, updating the template with the font change, a CR probably should’ve been put in
* FYI - SPF issues discussed; SPF fails cannot just be blocked, yet; plan needs to develop to help clients migrate to non-SPF fail; PR should likely be created, but not clear who should be point/owner of the PR; Marc will create a PR for further discussion at next week’s meeting
