1
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.260
We've got that extra license in June to call me as

2
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.080
A mistake. Yeah.

3
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.200
I'd have to type in my participant ID.

4
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.400
If I will call you on your

5
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.320
Journey to me.

6
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.800
Sometimes

7
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:54.240
Get that whole string. And so like I can call that from jabber Ryan will do that. But I don't have a headset. And so I just use my phone right

8
00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:10.920
So in jabber jabber controls my phone and so dials and everything. Everything's good. But because I'm essentially dialing in to the meeting as well as setting up, it needs to tie me to the bone, and it means that participant ID for

9
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.720
Versus if I can have it. Call me at my phone. Then he knows

10
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.470
Dark Johnny. No such luck.

11
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.380
And by the

12
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.780
Air. He probably has to say.

13
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.160
About that clock is wired it like that o'clock.

14
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.510
And

15
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.920
You

16
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:56.490
Know there's the room. You walk in, admin to the right. That's where houses all the equipment for the dead is that time mechanism. I didn't copy or think so and the local

17
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.010
Area, you can play the tune for play on

18
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.570
You can do some interesting things.

19
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.760
Like chopsticks are

20
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.660
Going to get into

21
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:15.510
It, man.

22
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.230
If there for me out tomorrow.

23
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.080
Will be able to

24
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.870
Now that you're here with me.

25
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.200
Go ahead.

26
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.670
No, it doesn't have to get detected

27
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:11.520
This one stolen subcommittee. So get some companies tried to me yesterday to look for a demo that Dr. Criteria waiting against so for being scheduled

28
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.830
Still getting

29
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.750
Oh, we did make progress on this. So last time the blocker was getting through the drop classes.

30
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.590
Something and noticed the way it was coated but we wound up having to use the API into

31
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:51.510
Banner, so that we can do the drop classes and we got that working. So we've got full end in thread add drop classes and now we're just doing building variations on it.

32
00:05:52.200 --> 00:06:02.070
To create the load test and then we'll need to figure out the environment to run the real load test against ideally, that would be proud, but who knows what it'll

33
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.580
Probably in the next for the next two weeks, we have this one done

34
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:44.070
Live to the owners are on the faculty staff noise. Also I want us to look at that link is Teddy's

35
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.580
Is this something that we could do Lucretia maybe

36
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.000
He's pulling it out.

37
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.780
That a trick question.

38
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:20.190
So basically they if you scroll down a bit. They have this on their website where they basically let their users know that this is the current operating system that is Aster

39
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:30.750
Current version. And then, you know, this is end of life by this date, and then we are going to push push this out to the campus by this date so if

40
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:43.500
If we could also do something like this. Then we probably won't have to worry about communication. Every time you're doing a voice upgrade. So I thought this was pretty neat. And we could probably do this.

41
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.870
Yeah, I like it.

42
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.480
Yeah, it would just

43
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.450
Being kind of integrating it into

44
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.280
Yeah.

45
00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:07.920
Yeah, we can. Okay, so I wrote something up and I spoke to Jordan and he told me to send it to Natalie, I'll do that. And then he said it triggers something out.

46
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:14.610
Yeah, I figured. Like I told her being dot CMS, they should be able to put something together and we

47
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:20.880
Can have someone that every time a new release. They come up and adjust that we do the text version of it.

48
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.920
About the approach of it so

49
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.460
You want to look at the list and

50
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.460
FMS. Oh, yes.

51
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:01.740
You

52
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.700
Click on the left of a

53
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:15.900
Yes, on all open and then double click on the line between entities. Yeah. So is that ok Acacia there'd be

54
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.250
A call one day or the owner name.

55
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:30.420
Some of them I couldn't find from the script. So we looked at MCA IMDB. And then there for some Evernote records in CMT we do

56
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.690
Whatever we could find. We put in their

57
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.120
Username

58
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.420
For some, not for all for some degree and finally username.

59
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.210
It's best to have username.

60
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.490
But if if a name is all you can

61
00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:58.470
Do

62
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:10.140
From the script I did use the name, last name, but from CNBC Forbes, and the name so

63
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:18.390
I can try it on in the script from the name and find out the username. I can try doing that. Yeah, like this one, DJ

64
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.280
did not hear that

65
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.300
That is covered

66
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.250
So the, the two things that she's talking about.

67
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.430
Right, we're going to upgrade all of these and then we'll be going to

68
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.750
campus wide at some point but

69
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.080
In kind of

70
00:10:54.690 --> 00:11:00.030
A REALIST very soon we're going to get to a place to where

71
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:17.610
We just suppress a feature update for 30 days and then we let it go live. We're not going to be trying to package an operating system and deploy it, and all that, because we're going to be able to keep up with it. There's no way so

72
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:26.790
The last time we did this and this time we do, we're doing it is really just testing out the upgrade process.

73
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.070
By taking the epics from Microsoft and pushing it out.

74
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:35.670
in place upgrade.

75
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.300
After two cycles is doing that.

76
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:54.750
1607 to 1709 and from 1709 to 1809 and if we don't have very many problems. I'm probably going to push very hard that

77
00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:56.970
We start doing

78
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:08.790
A probably they'll do it different than Texas state but you know there's Texas State doesn't even point to watch the state point directly to Microsoft and and let the machines. Just do as they will

79
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.540
Ours is going to be more of a

80
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:14.730
We will allow

81
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.340
The updates to come into us as well. Just suspend it from going to campus.

82
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:31.080
Maybe send a communication at the very beginning, while we're transitioning to people understanding this sheet hey feature update this comment.

83
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.640
You know, a 30 day date later and we let it go.

84
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:40.950
It's just, it's

85
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:51.360
I think Mark can attest to this from a lot of perspectives, because he runs into it to the Omm. The projects. The poem here in there.

86
00:12:52.350 --> 00:13:04.890
Give you hardly any time to put a lot into these upgrades and then you feel like you're being rushed and you feel like you know you could one little hiccup. And you could really cause some damage so

87
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:23.100
If there's a mechanism in place for us to be able to do that more automated fashion by using the the tools that are in place to do that instead of trying to reinvent the wheel. I think it's best to start with in that direction.

88
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:29.400
So this field over here 14 393 that's the operating system version better

89
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:43.800
I'm sorry, looking like an orange tag me is only good yeah move towards that you see for Sandra for that's going to be your Panasonic notebooks that they're not enhance the Panasonic ones. These are just faculty stuff that they're using

90
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:59.940
Then I have a bigger problem because Christopher shouldn't be in charge. Very machine it up. That is what he found from the IMDB. I, I could not even think those devices are get the information. So those are the ones that they got same day, we

91
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:11.190
should all be updating HP Compaq at 200 elite SF a PC or should we just tell them no. You got to get a bumpy so

92
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:33.870
If I think we're replacing the HP one when they are reaching the CRP cycle. So I don't have reached that point yet those things are at this point. Pretty sure they're quite old. I mean, I saw 780s in there. So, can be for therapy session.

93
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.500
Still having to do a wall where we go after it. Another way to go and replace all the machines right i mean

94
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:58.950
Because you may want to break it with a newer version of this stuff that causes greater problem. Unfortunately, we don't have any say in that process whatsoever.

95
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:14.550
We were talking, we are allowed to upgrade the operating system, the actual machine. We're allowed to make the I can make recommendations, hey, this machine doesn't have enough ramp didn't have on a hard drive space to be able to take this this upgrade and then

96
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.150
You know the tech shop would go and put more RAM in or

97
00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:19.620
On

98
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.160
Yeah, I don't know that.

99
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.560
Again, none of these

100
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.280
Have a problem with it because they all have Windows 10 already

101
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.910
And doing a feature upgrade.

102
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.300
To these machines. The chain.

103
00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:42.930
So,

104
00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:55.170
I don't know what it was when I had talked to Melissa, she had said something about what that date was that they were going to replace they weren't going to actively get rid of HP

105
00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:06.120
until they reach their life cycle. And I don't know if that time if they were doing it. I think there was some talks of say at 200 we're on our five year plan that we used to do or whatever.

106
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:17.790
And now we're on a four year plan. Those HP where she was still going to make them follow the five year plan before to replace them. And I don't know if that's still the case or not. I just know yeah we're trying to

107
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.510
Move over 500 behind on

108
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.350
That spreadsheet that we have had planned.

109
00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:30.750
On

110
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:35.460
A cloud we was able to do with all this and and the good

111
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:46.980
And the good thing that's going to help you always she will have the 1809 desktop here shortly ready to go to production. So

112
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:54.570
I don't like doing a massive upgrade to campus. We don't have that image in production.

113
00:16:55.110 --> 00:17:09.870
Because what you end up seeing is we upgrade everything out there. And then if y'all go and replace the machine you're going to put 1709 image on it, then it's going to have to update and it's just longer time in your shop. So we are currently we currently

114
00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:12.540
Have tested. Yes.

115
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:16.170
And we will be testing the lab imagery pretty quick.

116
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.380
The I will have you want to do with

117
00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:33.000
bank teller.

118
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.400
Traditionally,

119
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:41.520
Someone went over there and thumb drive because when we start doing

120
00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:53.160
The pipe we kill their network. We found it out last time doing a software application and the songs we hammered the phones because you'll remember yeah we killed the whole network.

121
00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:05.790
And so historically what we've done is one is we we pull that group out BP BP and then we work with the tech shop, who we can go over there and thumb drive and upgrade to them.

122
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:24.960
Or you can actually go over there. We can make it available and software center and you can run it, but it's it's a it's a few at a time. So, two or three did today two or three tomorrow. We can't do a I wanted like we would anything I already found out

123
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:35.490
Was that I already completed our. What do you mean the first hundred that I had upgraded light bank our building.

124
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:42.000
234 those who are already upgraded. Yes. Out of those I

125
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:51.360
And I remember that they show up successful in SEC, you know, we can we go ahead than where it has the build number because that doesn't mean a lot to everyone here okay if there's

126
00:18:51.540 --> 00:19:00.150
If it has a build number that ninja to been upgraded. You want me to even highlight that. Okay, so I can see these have already been done. Okay. I do that.

127
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:01.470
Okay.

128
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:06.390
Nevermind.

129
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.130
Over there.

130
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.540
No every day, small numbers so

131
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.500
What we're going to run into that problem is when we go to do the campus.

132
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.140
There's quite a few machines over there.

133
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.430
That will be moved, almost ready to close. Okay, then I'll

134
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.920
Just make sure the documentation is kind of equals one.

135
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.050
Oh no, has the final registry DPI checked in the

136
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.780
Period mentioned last week that one of that. So that's been run into the problem were too small.

137
00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.330
Who are now the registry DPI track. Yeah, so

138
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:12.720
We've actually talked with Aramark, and we talked with the tech shop and we actually physically went out there and it was they were only experiencing that problem over

139
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:14.940
My

140
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:25.560
Over at NGO at Starbucks. The other locations were not. I don't want to to run something across all of them.

141
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:37.920
For fear of if it's working fine for them and they're not experienced that problem with finances can be it can change the way that the I feel like they would complain. We've given the tech shop, the ability, which I think

142
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:49.260
You saw them on. If you do run into that this is all you got to do so they can be reacted if they have to. But we have that was literally the only person that's complained about it all, we've even seen it.

143
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.940
Glad to help

144
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:21.900
You, but how many are you getting. I mean, this is there any sense of progress progress is

145
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:48.300
So change will push the same love this past week. She's her emotions.

146
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.320
So now the next step is we get to test to the

147
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.630
Things that were no need to

148
00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.850
Change some

149
00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:06.750
Saturday morning to test this out. This next time we do it. I need other people to assist in the testing applications.

150
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:20.430
Because while systems knows. Many of the applications. We don't know all of them. And so if there's something else that this is breaking that, you know, was previously noted during the day, because I know Cisco finance. I don't even know what it is.

151
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:34.380
We need somebody to test this stuff. So we because the plan right now is take us down again in December for a prolonged period of time and you know

152
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:45.510
We don't want to have bigger problems that occur during that time. Additionally, this server could crash anytime, which means that anything that's currently broken by this

153
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:54.570
Is going to be broken by this. And so, you know, our plan right now is to go ahead and schedule another evening or early morning

154
00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.010
soiree into this activity and try and

155
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.360
Find out if we're good or not and

156
00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:11.160
Hopefully we are good again I you know there's there's things about this. I couldn't tell you what what all

157
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:16.680
Issues that may occur this because, you know, we don't use all these applications. So

158
00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.940
Now our request is we're going to have other people here probably

159
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.470
Networking service desk.

160
00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.890
We're still waiting on

161
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.410
Marker to

162
00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:51.930
Still work on that.

163
00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:53.760
Search request.

164
00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.930
To the

165
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:08.850
Let me check the tip. It's just the simple like all the

166
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.220
Address on the coding

167
00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.790
Best form, but had a note.

168
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:38.220
For last week that 668 was when we reopen yeah I tried. I couldn't record. It was resolved, and I wanted to ask, do I open problematic.

169
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:50.490
Or can you circle okay i i'd rather have somebody in the next five and 668 for me. Okay.

170
00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:54.960
Perfect.

171
00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:01.530
52 more

172
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:04.890
Okay.

173
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:14.640
That works. So I'm working with them. We were trying to kind of talked about it in the device project.

174
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:19.980
That we want to basically recreate

175
00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:25.020
All and turn off off on file sinking.

176
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:26.610
And

177
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:38.760
Nobody you know redirection and then put some testers in that in that oh you in that group and start testing it out. Do not know we have that

178
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.430
You know,

179
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:56.280
I'm working Monday when I am tough for that. So once we we can get that up and running will be soliciting folks to put into that, so they can test it, that it should. It should behave

180
00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:12.330
Very similar to the way your man's laptop behaves now with a couple of exceptions. One, you won't have the offline thinking situation going on and then you won't have the redirection so your desktop and things like that.

181
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:14.490
They're not going to

182
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:19.800
follow you around, they're not going to be saved in the traditional sense that they are now.

183
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:27.210
And if, as you're testing it. I would move the testers and like at the service desk, especially

184
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:33.870
to notate those kind of things because there's probably going to have to be something that if we move forward with this.

185
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:42.900
That we will have to walk clients through because you're going to probably we can send a communication that are still going to Paul would call him I would have to walk them through how this is done. I

186
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:48.300
Don't know if that's the route that we're going. I just know that we're testing it right now because

187
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:58.440
Client Side sneaking with high availability on the server side is just not a good combo.

188
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:04.800
offline files is not a good strategy, considering it's so old and outdated.

189
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:15.300
And we really don't know that we have something out there right now, other than Work Folders with the thought was, we're trying to give them the same experience that they would have here, right.

190
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:23.940
As best we can with the experience here is if I take your network cable out and use network connectivity, you know, all have access to your FTP, Dr.

191
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:33.330
Well, that's the same thing that we're about to be testing if you're on the network direct access kicks in. You got access S and T. You're on the network. Everything's golden

192
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:45.690
If you have no network connectivity, you're still working on a laptop, you can still do everything that you normally would do on a laptop create document, so on and so forth. But you won't be able to access SMP resources.

193
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:55.020
Seems to be pretty standard across the board and other educational institutions and in the corporate world or they use some

194
00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:03.060
Always on VPN type technology that they're using other than direct access for some of these things. But as far as the offline file.

195
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:12.900
Stuff. Very few people have any even use that technology anymore. So I have a quick question. If they haven't unmanaged

196
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:24.810
Date they anyways, do not have access to it as Dr. They do not have access to do that. They have an unmanaged the user my access VPN to get access to this and teacher

197
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:32.910
You have redistributing and so Jesse account to login. Right. Yes. Yes. So they don't have access to that. So that is what I'm saying.

198
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:53.010
And they also do not have access to them. My Documents or anything. So when they and because we have a large number of unmanaged laptops. Right. So I want to know, how are they actually like thinking their files or anything around. Are they just using one guy or they don't care about it.

199
00:28:55.110 --> 00:29:04.530
Because you guys are happy with that. And when we're moving them to this solution, they're not happy with it right so if if you're just getting rid of it and

200
00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:21.390
They are seeing no change, then we can just go ahead with it without trying to cause problems for ourselves drivers are actually not true, they're not happy with the solution because through direct access on a slow connection. It's noticeably different than

201
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.880
Not being on direct access

202
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:35.910
So is this the speed to be able to access resources and the speed to be able to do things that you're right. So we've just gotten to in this week where

203
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:44.430
Network connection at home isn't great, but there's one that the husband and wife, and one has an advantage in one

204
00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:55.560
Need a network and one of them can't. Why can't do anything. And we're never going to overcome that, will it help if we get rid of

205
00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:06.480
Offline will. I mean, we know that they're having the essence G drive access stuff that we're running into and accessing those files and sinking and cache getting corrupted and all that. Yes.

206
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:18.630
The speed at which it operates through direct access. No, that's just how it is. Right. If you have a slow connection direct access is going to be slower than you just being on your network, right.

207
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.300
And then piping that with going through a slow connection at home is just augments the problem.

208
00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:40.620
I would be willing to bet you that if that person on that unmanaged laptop uses SSL VPN, and he has a crappy network connection at home, he'll experience s AMP T drive access about the same. So they're not she's not. She's just worried about

209
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:57.540
But I'll load again versus the tongue. Yeah, you can mitigate that by going to mail. Yeah. Yeah. And that would reverse the tunnel. Yeah. And that, I think it's we so honestly

210
00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:07.380
We were in testing and theory we moved it into a post implementation testing phase and then these things.

211
00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:13.770
decided it was production because we started doing up D, we started doing these people, things started getting flown out

212
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:27.510
All of these vetting type thing where we inform the client never got a chance to happen. So if you give them a managed laptop and you tell them, hey, you can use Outlook. It's going to be slower because of the tunnel.

213
00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:35.790
If you don't want that go to mail that is a church issue and you have that problem. We really never had a chance to do that. And so

214
00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:38.430
I will say that

215
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.180
You know, managed apps and systems.

216
00:31:43.380 --> 00:32:00.690
Continuously bulk that of keep pounding these out there and then you know you gotta go with your lead and my lead was that we need to start doing these things and we never really you know we we got to a point where an initial deliverable was

217
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:12.000
High Availability well because of resources and things like that that was moved out of a deliverable. So we don't have high deliverable of this service and so

218
00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:21.570
If there's work that needs to be done on this for it to be something that our clients are gonna like

219
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.660
In my opinion, yeah.

220
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.820
But

221
00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:39.150
What what I think the overall concern was is we never kept track of unmanaged things we put out there.

222
00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:51.930
So we don't know how many of those we put out there. If we were to continue down that route to continue to do that, in turn, while this all gets figured out there would have to be better tracking mechanisms on that because

223
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:58.230
I'm asked how many of those machines out there and manage that I can move to manage and

224
00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:05.220
I could flip the quarter and thing again. I haven't been on it. Yes, so

225
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:10.410
Direction. We're going is just some type of a managed device.

226
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:21.480
Some of these testing will do will get us a better idea of how we're going to move forward with that. And then it's a communication at that time when we handle mouth. Maybe it's a document that tells them.

227
00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.910
These are things that you need to expect with this device. And this is how you overcome those at those deals

228
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:45.480
Working

229
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.740
I do

230
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:09.840
I understand. I read the resolution, I read everything their process were followed it was sound. Nothing would have been done differently.

231
00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:21.870
I think we need to not be so quick. We got to someone said something about this and we're scared, things are going to happen. So we see something that we just immediately disabled.

232
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:33.630
Because like I said, we did something like this once before and we basically made everybody's computer on campus for about three hours unusable. Because we killed explored it

233
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:45.090
Because someone said there's a process that can overrun explored it exceeded while they saw it. So they went campus wide. I think we need to

234
00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:52.080
Do a little bit more diligence than just prematurely pulling the trigger on things like this.

235
00:34:52.860 --> 00:35:03.420
I think it is prematurely poetry and that's why the hypocrisy. I think Santa Claus really pull a trigger or why don't we, why don't we do some testing. Why don't we think about this, why don't we do this before that.

236
00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:15.210
Same thing in these situations. Let's go lose, lose situation to the one of the gentlemen like you know brainstorm where by themed and we'd be having a different conversation we should pull the trigger faster. So, yeah.

237
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:19.500
Which is

238
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:20.880
Yeah.

239
00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:24.510
I'd rather go this way. Yeah.

240
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:30.840
Get him. What is happening with some of the ransomware stuff reading some of those articles about

241
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.600
Whatever the

242
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:46.260
Interim provider kind of thing, whereas dentist. Another they go to them for their stuff that's where the rents. Where's my understanding in this

243
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:58.140
Was that something came in and then they reacted without even really looking at what that file was or what it affected because they immediately called us and said, What is this

244
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:06.390
I said that's Google that's Chrome. Well, going remembering what price at last week. And what I think the processes are

245
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:10.050
There.

246
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.840
They're operating on a little more of a high wire than, say,

247
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:24.570
I think this is what I was trained on more of a high wire than say you are a

248
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:26.940
Reason.

249
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:34.380
Why, because the security implications are they getting whatever your security implications and everything without

250
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:35.880
The

251
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:49.410
sound cues. But, I mean, I don't want to be gone and what what i heard in here is we would rather be more restrictive and and apologize for that doing due diligence. If I do that.

252
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:57.150
I get hammered for it. And my job is to secure these workstations, because they don't do anything other than fire and

253
00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:06.180
Anytime something comes out. They tell me I want this push right now if I push this app out there are this update and it wasn't properly tested and it breaks it

254
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:20.580
The explaining is not as explained to the customer. Is it me explaining to my boss why broken on campus. So what I remember him saying was, this wasn't an immediate thing they did research it for 20 to 30 minutes

255
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:31.830
And at that point, they weren't able to find anything that said, hey, this is okay and rather than be sorry. They blocked it.

256
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.930
And then it was blocked for 15 to 20 minutes and then unblocked when they finally found out what the problem was.

257
00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:57.870
Okay, and one more point is, is this is not the first time and this one happened to be a small, the last time that I remember them doing this. It was ours and it affected the entire campus. So what I would suggest

258
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:04.620
Stephen is not here more anybody from his areas. How about we table this and bring it back up.

259
00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:14.730
let him answer for asking to listen to the record. Yeah, for in this part, yes. And then be here next week to talk

260
00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:27.570
What I remember from last week was he said that the file details that they get an app was not populated completely

261
00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:41.610
And they were treating it as ransomware until they got more details. That is why they blocked it. If they're known from earlier on, that it was a Chrome executable. Then they wouldn't have that was what I said.

262
00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:02.910
I mean, you bring up good points are discussing.

263
00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.340
Please getting aired out

264
00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:08.640
I don't know what the solution will be, but I think

265
00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:17.940
If we detect something and we can't find anything that is explicitly telling us that it's something I think it's premature to block it.

266
00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:24.450
If you don't, if you don't really know what you're blocking you don't have any idea what the impact is going to be

267
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:39.330
20 or 30 minutes was probably a knee jerk reaction, in my opinion, I don't think that's enough. Now something hit across the wire and everyone was talking about it everywhere. And there's there's major thing going on. Yeah, sometimes you have to do that. But I don't think that was this case.

268
00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:51.360
Alright, this one I for sure. I forgot to think about it that he got offended. He didn't pick up on the fact that the notification that

269
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.970
I will

270
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.840
Let me

271
00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.540
Get this document and close out

272
00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:20.100
And that leaves the new ones. Last week SPF yes able to touch base with Casey. He did some more identification of some other sites IPS sent out, but I haven't been able to talk with friends tour barks Winky about it.

273
00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.870
So with this list, Mark, do is update that as

274
00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:46.290
Well, a Gore and we're going to run into problems on a lot of these because they. There are so many addresses that they utilize

275
00:40:46.890 --> 00:41:00.120
We're gonna need to split them into a sub domain. And that's going to take some more because we're gonna have to get them and start sending from this sub domain probably set a call from address on it, it's going to take. Hold on.

276
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:03.270
That's literally just a list of everything.

277
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:10.560
Please progress.

278
00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.490
That is the end of our lives.

279
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:21.540
Anybody who was it 668 yes it's really awesome. Thank you so much.

280
00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:36.120
On that list, just to give you an update on that exclusion list for the stuff that still had Jerry on it. We were able to remove

281
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:46.050
TISA spanner server because it was for revisions and they supposedly fix that. So we remove that we were able to remove it from

282
00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:58.410
All of the machines at Ray's life maintenance. They were in that exclusion group, and there was only two of them that actually need it because they remote into them. So we removed it from all the

283
00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:07.560
About total of 12 machines there. It looks like the rest of them that are there have something to do with

284
00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:15.240
Atomic so I'll have to be visiting the girl again.

285
00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:22.920
One deal for the for the library one machine or the library and then

286
00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:28.050
There are a couple machines out there for the Allen press

287
00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:35.490
But if atomic something can be done there. You're talking about five, six machines.

288
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:47.460
On campus. I think I feel confident and going and asking for, you know, $200 annually to keep those Java licenses up versus 30

289
00:42:49.230 --> 00:43:01.800
So we reached out to them. We figured it all out. I got a spreadsheet, as we're removing them. I will be attaching it now that this problem records back up will attach that spreadsheet to here and we will, you know,

290
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.570
Remove it and put it up there and remove it and put it up there as it's updated, but we're getting close to mitigating that

291
00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:13.350
So I could be wrong, but I think Mike

292
00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:24.390
made some changes in the back end for the devil atomic but he's not using Rocco Java and he configured for a dog felt that was the case. Yeah, I thought

293
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:30.120
I didn't do element, but do not have a production is a good point. We need to check

294
00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:44.370
Because that's the bars. I know the only people that have to have this is Enterprise Services, folks. It's nobody else. So if y'all have something in place, let us know and we will get rid of it on those machines.

295
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:47.220
Thank you.

296
00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:54.030
Anything else

297
00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:57.570
Like to run

298
00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.940
Total the spreadsheet to attach it to your

299
00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:15.960
Part. Yeah. Having highlight on the right hand side it either said pending says remember she makes your hands that updated before sit up there.
