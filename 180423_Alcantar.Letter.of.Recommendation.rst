To Whom It May Concern:

I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Michael Alcantar who is applying for
admissions t​o the Information Assurance and Security, Master of Science program at Sam
Houston State University​. I met Michael in my capacity as the IT@Sam Service Desk supervisor.
Michael was and continues to be an excellent employee based on his punctuality, superior
quality & quantity of work, and thorough troubleshooting skills.

As a student worker, Michael demonstrated an above average set of work skills which included
a high call handling ratio, high first call resolution, and high ready time. He was also entrusted
with teaching new employees and handling more complex technical issues. Michael also
showed no hesitation in taking on additional tasks assigned to him. After 6 months, due to his
continued quality of work, he was promoted and took on the role of student team lead. As a
team lead, many students referred to him for assistance due to his knowledge of our systems.
Michael continued to mature and exhibit strong work ethics during his time as a student
worker. When a full time position opened up, there was no doubt that Michael would be the
perfect addition to the team. He had demonstrated the level of troubleshooting and customer
service skills to excel in the position. Michael has now been a full time staff member for four
years which during that time he was promoted once again from a Technician I to a Technician II.

I am positive that Michael will prove to be a successful and valuable student in the ​Information
Assurance and Security, Master of Science program based on his education, self-motivation,
willingness to take on challenges and work well with others. He has managed to develop
professionally while balancing his school work without having an impact to his academics or
employment. If you would like additional information, please do not hesitate to give me a call
at (936) 294-4115.
