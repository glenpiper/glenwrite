## 2018-19 APA Self Evaluation  

**(1) Describe your most notable accomplishments during the past year.**  

> * Guiding the Service Desk through a stable (i.e., no FTE vacancies) calendar 2018, wherein we were able to focus on process & documentation improvements, and then moving to quickly fill a vacancy beginning in January 2019;
> * Receiving affirmation that we’ve been successful in meeting the necessity of making the right hiring choices/additions to the team, as our vacancy was caused by a SD FTE moving up to a position in Managed Applications;
> * Continuing progress in mapping out staff professional development goals that are in proper alignment with group/department/division goals. Ensuring that the Service Desk FTE staff received the professional development opportunities to enable the Service Desk to qualify for HDI Team Certified Pinnacle of Excellence Award;
> * Solidifying the relationship between the SD and Tech Shop-A/V-Labs and Classrooms, focusing on improvements in communication & processes between the two areas. This has been of particular importance in further identifying & implementing CS support offerings at TWC, clarifying the path towards increased resources for, and offerings to, TWC and the College of Medicine;
> * I’m pleased that I was accepted into the initial cohort of the SHSU Master Mentor program. This will not only afford me a way to further develop my interpersonal/managerial skills, but will also allow me to begin giving back to the SHSU community.
> 

**(2) What challenges did you experience in accomplishing your goals and job responsibilities during the past year?**  
> * Frankly, the primary challenge this past year was keeping up with the increasing pace of change, and then successfully integrating that change into the Service Desk’s operational processes;
> * A second challenge was the continuing staffing challenges/shortfall at TWC, which continued to present a significant risk to meeting our 10mp obligations & goals. While the interim solution of relying on student labor presented recruiting and logistical challenges, we were able to make it work. We met our increased obligations with minimal exceptions, while maintaining solid working relationships with leadership at TWC;
> * A third challenge was the changes that were implemented in the FTE hiring process, particularly in the process for filling the Tech I position. Fortunately, flexibility, along with cooperation & communication by leadership, enabled this to be an easily conquered challenge.
> 

**(3) What are your key goals for the coming year?**  
> * Stop just putting out fires & reacting, and make progress towards developing & implementing more purposeful, proactive, data-based, and client-centric solutions (i.e., Be more mindful in improving the SD);
> * Prioritize the pursuit of ITIL Problem Management training/certification (i.e., Be more mindful in professional development);
> * Work with managers in Asset Management & Tech Shop to continue the identification & implementation of process improvements, including the proactive design of support services & processes needed at TWC & College of Medicine (i.e., Be more mindful about teamwork);
> * Mentor the Service Desk staff, such that we continue to improve processes, communication, understanding, and progress toward making the Service Desk a place that our clients (internal and external) want to consult for reliable support & solutions (i.e., Be more mindful about leadership);
> 

**(4) What areas need development in the coming year?**  
> * Prioritization/Time Management;
> * Communication - Internal (SD) - Particularly the clear & regular communication of updates & changes to the team;  
> * Communication - Internal (IT@Sam) - More clearly articulating SD needs & requirements to other groups, as well as more actively/mindfully soliciting & understanding their needs & requirements;  
> * Communication - External (Clients) - More proactive, mindful communication & engagement with client base;  
> * Budget Planning - Be more proactive & mindful about developing & championing the budgetary components related to requested/planned/proposed improvements to/for the Service Desk.
