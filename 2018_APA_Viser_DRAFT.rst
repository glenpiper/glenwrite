**1. ADHERENCE TO POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND RULES:**

    **Consider the employee's knowledge and understanding as related to individual's internal control responsibilities.**

    **5 - Exceeds** -  Has completely mastered knowledge of policies, procedures, and rules
    **4 - Above** - Knowledge of policies, procedures, and rules is frequently above that expected
    **3 - Acceptable** - Has an adequate knowledge of policies, procedures, and rules
    **2 - Below** - Understanding of policies, procedures, and rules is somewhat below normal expectations
    **1 - Does Not Meet** - Has a minimum understanding of policies, procedures, and rules

    **Weight:** 10%

    Selected: 4

    **Comments:**

    DJ has an exceptional knowledge of the policies and procedures that are unique to TWC, and does an admirable job of keeping me aware of them, as well as keeping them as well integrated with general IT/CS policies & processes as possible.


**2. ATTITUDE:**

    **Consider the employee's manner, disposition or orientation exhibited in daily efforts.**

    **5 - Exceeds** - Has a positive and encouraging attitude and makes a positive contribution to morale
    **4 - Above** - Shows pride in work
    **3 - Acceptable** - Maintains a good attitude the majority of the time, though improvement could be made
    **2 - Below** - Lacks a positive attitude towards work environment
    **1 - Does Not Meet** - Often argumentative; considered unreceptive and antagonistic

    **Weight:** 9%

    Selected: 4

    **Comments:**

    DJ invariably has a great attitude, even when things get quirky and/or really frustrating. He has an affability that lends itself to making him successful as the lone IT/CS representative at a site as busy as TWC. I regularly get comments and reports regarding the esteem in which he is held.


**3. EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION:**

    **Consider how employee responds and interacts with employees and others within SHSU or groups outside of SHSU.**

    **5 - Exceeds** - Builds rapport with a variety of people; develops alliances to work together toward common goals
    **4 - Above** - Effectively handles difficult external relations
    **3 - Acceptable** - Adapts self to others and to most situations; seeks guidance when needed
    **2 - Below** - Sometimes rigid and defensive with outside departments
    **1 - Does Not Meet** - Lacks understanding of external departments; fails to consider their impact on other departments

    **Weight:** 9%

    Selected: 5

    **Comments:**

    As noted previously, DJ works extremely well with a large (and often demanding) cross section of clients, ranging from students to staff to faculty, to administrators, to guests & visitors. And as a representative of four Client Services groups (Service Desk, Tech Shop, A/V, Labs & Classrooms), DJ is interacting with that client base in a wider range of roles than would be the case on main campus. He has built, and actively maintains, a reputation as friendly, approachable, knowledgeable, and effective.


**4. INITIATIVE:**

    **Consider employee’s ingenuity for completing extra or self-initiated projects or assignments, adaptability to change, and employee’s initiative in completing assignments ahead of schedule.**

    **5 - Exceeds** - Develops new ideas and methods to improve quality of results
    **4 - Above** - Seeks additional knowledge pertaining to job
    **3 - Acceptable** - Follows formal instructions as necessary
    **2 - Below** - Shows little interest in current practices relating to job
    **1 - Does Not Meet** - Unwilling to demonstrate interest in gaining new knowledge

    **Weight:** 9%

    Selected: 4

    **Comments:**

    Out of necessity, DJ wears many hats. When given the proper training and instruction, he is able to get things done. He actively seeks to expand his base of knowledge and skill. He has also demonstrated an appreciation of the importance of taking initiative to get things done, not just waiting to be told to do something.



**5. INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS:**

    **Consider whether employee works harmoniously and effectively with fellow employees, management and students.**

    **5 - Exceeds** - Goes out of way to promote good interpersonal relations; very cooperative
    **4 - Above** - Effectively handles difficult interpersonal relations
    **3 - Acceptable** - Adapts self to others and to most situations; seeks guidance when needed
    **2 - Below** - Sometimes rigid and defensive; does not foster good working environment
    **1 - Does Not Meet** - Fails to consider others; not courteous; lacks understanding

    **Weight:** 9%

    Selected: 3

    **Comments:**

    From a Service Desk perspective, DJ is a very good teammate and gets along extremely well with everyone. This past year a more concerted effort was made to try and better integrate him into the team flows of Tech Shop, A/V, and Labs & Classrooms. While some progress was made, the physical separation and the past view of DJ as just a Service Desk member served to make things a little more challenging. I believe that much progress will be made in the coming year, particularly once a new manager for Tech Shop, A/V, and Labs & Classrooms comes aboard.


**6. JOB KNOWLEDGE:**

    **Consider employee’s knowledge of duties, responsibilities of position, and how the employee applies technical knowledge, education, and experience to job requirements.**

    **5 - Exceeds** - Has completely mastered job; strives to learn more/improve job skills
    **4 - Above** - Understands all phases of work; most job duties mastered
    **3 - Acceptable** - Has adequate grasp of job requirements; is able to learn new aspects of job
    **2 - Below** - Lacks knowledge of some phases of work
    **1 - Does Not Meet** - Unable to complete job duties; poor understanding of job

    **Weight:** 9%

    Selected: 3

    **Comments:**

    Again, through no real fault of his own, DJ suffered from the many hats he wears. From a Service Desk perspective, DJ easily earned a "4-Above" and I would also rank his work in much of his Tech Shop duties to be in the 3-4 range (leaning to a 4). That said, the issue lies with his A/V skills & knowledge. DJ has a decent working knowledge, in that does an admirable job keeping that technology base up and running. However, he suffers from a lack of specific, related training that would serve to enhance his experience & practice, and allow him to be more efficient and effective.


**7. ORGANIZATION AND USE OF TIME:**

    **Consider employee’s ability to organize and prioritize their work and how effectively time is used.**

    **5 - Exceeds** - Extremely capable in coordinating tasks in changing situations
    **4 - Above** - Plans skillfully; handles unusual situations well
    **3 - Acceptable** - Completes assignments within time expected; meets schedules
    **2 - Below** - Difficulty in determining priority and schedule of duties
    **1 - Does Not Meet** - Ineffective in routine tasks; cannot prioritize or schedule

    **Weight:** 9%

    Selected: 4

    **Comments:**

    By dint of necessity, DJ is good at planning (both by/for himself, and in conjunction with others when looped in), and he has demonstrated repeatedly that he can handled whatever unusual situations get thrown his way.


**8. QUALITY OF WORK:**

    **5 - Exceeds** - Requires minimum supervision; consistently thorough and accurate
    **4 - Above** - Requires little supervision; is exact and precise most of the time; seldom makes errors
    **3 - Acceptable** - Usually accurate; makes minimal errors
    **2 - Below** - Makes above average number of errors; final product often needs revision or correction
    **1 - Does Not Meet** - Makes frequent and recurrent errors

    **Weight:** 9%

    Selected: 4

    **Comments:**

    DJ does good work across all his duties. He requires little oversight/direct supervision, and I can count on him to contact me when he has questions or needs direction.


**9. QUANTITY OF WORK:**

    **Consider assignments completed, overall productivity, and amount of work done during the workday.**

    **5 - Exceeds** - Produces consistently high volume of work; extremely productive and fast
    **4 - Above** - Volume of work frequently above that which is expected
    **3 - Acceptable** - Volume of work is limited to tasks assigned
    **2 - Below** - Volume of work is generally below what is expected; does just enough to get by
    **1 - Does Not Meet** - Minimum requirements not met; volume of work generally unsatisfactory

    **Weight:** 9%

    Selected: 4

    **Comments:**

    As stated several times, DJ wears many hats and so it follows that he does a lot of things & produces a lot of work product. Every day he gets a lot of different things done.


**10. RESPONSIBILITY AND DEPENDABILITY:**

    **Consider the employee’s willingness to take on assignments and be held accountable.**

    **5 - Exceeds** - Requires minimum supervision; seeks additional responsibility; is very reliable
    **4 - Above** - Reliable; requires little supervision; carries through effectively
    **3 - Acceptable** - Usually takes care of necessary tasks and completes them with reasonable promptness
    **2 - Below** - Frequently requires prompting; often fails to meet deadlines
    **1 - Does Not Meet** - Unreliable; requires close supervision; does not accept responsibility

    **Weight:** 9%

    Selected: 4

    **Comments:**

    DJ is a hard worker, dependable and responsible. He has proven this repeatedly over his time working at TWC, and did so again this year. Every day he gets pulled in many different directions, doing many different things, and every day I know that I can rely on him to get it all completed, the right way, and have satisfied clients.


**11. USE OF REQUIRED TECHNOLOGY:**

    **Consider how employee utilizes the resources provided by SHSU Information Technology Services.**

    **5 - Exceeds** - Has mastery level knowledge of required technology and as new ideas or technologies are introduced, is able to learn and use them swiftly and appropriately
    **4 - Above** - Has substantial knowledge of required technology
    **3 - Acceptable** - Possesses skills and knowledge to perform their job competently
    **2 - Below** - Needs to expand knowledge of basic technology
    **1 - Does Not Meet** - Lacks basic knowledge of technology

    **Weight:** 9%

    Selected: 4

    **Comments:**

    DJ has learned a great many different things and built a great base of knowledge and skills. He especially knows how things work at TWC, and how the technologies & resources that we make available work in that environment. Additionally, he also knows these technologies & resources well enough that he can provide high quality phone support to non-TWC clients, such that they don't even know that he's at TWC.


**12. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENT:**

    **Has the employee met the professional development training requirement? (8 hours for staff or 12 hours for managers). A response is required.**

    **Comments:**

    DJ has met this requirement.


**13. PERFORMANCE STRENGTHS:**

    **Please highlight the employee's performance strengths in the section provided. Provide short, bullet-style comments for discussion during the employee conference.**

    **Comments:**

    Self-Motivation/Direction
    Desire to Expand Knowledge & Skills
    Ability to Handle Changes/Uncertainty


**14. AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:**

    **Please highlight the employee's areas for improvement in the section provided. Provide short, bullet-style comments for discussion during the employee conference.**

    **Comments:**

    Documentation - develop skills to enhance utility of ticket documentation for Tier 2/3 use/effectiveness and any future forensic/investigative troubleshooting needs
    Communication & Integration - especially once new Tech Shop, A/V, Labs & Classrooms manager comes aboard, work on getting more fully & effectively integrated into those group's workflows
    Skill Set Expansion - especially A/V
