## Toggl.Memo.to.FTE  

Back last Fall, as part of the larger effort to prioritize the projects requested by campus groups, the EMT discussed the topic of resource allocation. While the shared anecdotal experience was/is that, across the division, we are all doing as much as we can with what we have (i.e., everyone is already close to redlining), objective projections, allocations, and decisions couldn’t be made without first gathering accurate data on what staff are currently spending their time on.

This resulted in the selection of [Toggl][1] as a simple & effective tool to facilitate the logging & tracking of time spent. A test/pilot of Toggl was implemented during the last third of the Fall semester. Client Services, Enterprise Services, and Project Management all designated specific staff to participate in the test (e.g., the SD was represented by Norma), while ISS & Security implemented an “all-hands” rollout, wherein every staff member in those departments were required to begin using Toggl as a standard practice.

More recently (within the past three weeks), driven by the development of the Project Priority List *(the official list of 45-50 in-progress projects (some of y’all might remember the past ridiculousness of “BIG P” vs “little p” P/projects —\> this list is the “BIG P” projects…))* there’s been a push to more formally begin gathering activity data so that it can be broken down into “buckets” for analysis. *(tidbit: the Gantt chart for the first draft of the PPL indicated that, at current staffing/resource levels, it would take just over 3 years to complete, **IF** no other projects were added!)*

I was asked to provide Terry with the percentages of SD activities that fell into 3 main buckets, along with the “sub-buckets” that the majority of our activities would fall into. I’ve attached the Excel sheets that I used to determine the info that I sent along to Terry - please give them a look & let me know if you have any questions (note: I had to make some kinda big assumptions, but I think it yielded results that are easily in the realm of likelihood…).

So, what this all means is that I need y’all (the FTE - this won’t be required of the student techs) to start tracking your time using Toggl. You just need to go to the Toggl website, create an account, download the desktop app/mobile app or use the web interface, and then begin tracking your time.

* Notes:
	* The intent is **NOT** to micromanage your time/activities —\> i.e., I/we don’t care when you go to the restroom or get coffee/lunch; rather, it’s about seeing how/to what your work time is allocated;
	* It is not meant to be granular; rather, it’s meant to  yield/show aggregate “buckets” over time;
	* In order to help in getting started, here are the nine “sub-buckets” that I identified as being most useful to SD staff:
		1. Cherwell Tickets
		2. Answering Phones
		3. 10mp
		4. Process HD Email
		5. Walk-ins
		6. Manage Checkout Laptops
		7. Account Management
		8. Projects (this is primarily mine)
		9. Meetings
	* **For DJ:**  You’ll also need to check with Louise, to see if she has any specifics that she wants tracked for her groups. As for your increasing Asset Mgmt tasks, I’d recommend tracking them & seeing what all accumulates, before worrying about getting another manager involved (no disrespect to Cathy…)
