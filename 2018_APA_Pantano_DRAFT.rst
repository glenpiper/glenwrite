    Josh has been a quick study, learning a great deal about our technology environment in a relatively short time. He is quickly overcoming his lack of a deep technical base, using his solid tech skill set & his very strong desire to learn, to rapidly absorb new knowledge & skills.

    Josh is very reliable and responsible. I can count on him to know what he is supposed to do, to do what he is asked to do, and to be responsible for asking good questions when he needs guidance.
