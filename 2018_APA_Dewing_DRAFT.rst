    Will can be counted on to get the majority of his work done promptly and within deadlines. Time management and prioritization, however, are areas in which Will does need to spend some time & effort. Given his level of experience, time with us, and attitude, I'm not concerned. I look forward to the improvements that will come in this area.

    **Comments:**

    Again, Will is where I would expect him to be in terms of work output quality. Time and experience will bring with them a commensurate jump in quality, as mastering the basics will free Will up to concentrate more on the qualitative factors that differentiate adequate support from top-notch services & support.

    Selected: 3

    **Comments:**

    Will is basically a solid and reliable member of our team. There have been a couple of issues related to the process of adjusting to a full-time, 8-5 job, but those were easily discussed and dealt with in a positive manner. In all other ways relating to responsibility and dependability, Will completely measures up.

    **Comments:**

    Will has a very strong technical base, and he used his time as a student tech well in that he learned our basic technologies (Cherwell, desktop & laptop images) well enough to shorten his learning curve and give him a leg up, and begin learning other technologies sooner than he might have otherwise.
